# 🌳 Decision Tree Challenge - Feature Importance and Variable Encoding

## Challenge Overview

**Your Mission:** Create a simple GitHub Pages site that demonstrates how decision trees measure feature importance and analyzes the critical differences between categorical and numerical variable encoding. You'll answer two key discussion questions by adding narrative to a pre-built analysis and posting those answers to your GitHub Pages site as a rendered HTML document.

## ⚠️ AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance → Awareness → Learning → Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.

## The Decision Tree Problem 🎯

> "The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn't said." - Peter Drucker

**The Core Problem:** Decision trees are often praised for their interpretability and ability to handle both numerical and categorical variables. But what happens when we encode categorical variables as numbers? How does this affect our understanding of feature importance?

**What is Feature Importance?** In decision trees, feature importance measures how much each variable contributes to reducing impurity (or improving prediction accuracy) across all splits in the tree. It's a key metric for understanding which variables matter most for your predictions.

::: {.callout-important}
## 🎯 The Key Insight: Encoding Matters for Interpretability

**The problem:** When we encode categorical variables as numerical values (like 1, 2, 3, 4...), decision trees treat them as if they have a meaningful numerical order. This can completely distort our analysis.

**The Real-World Context:** In real estate, we know that neighborhood quality, house style, and other categorical factors are crucial for predicting home prices. But if we encode these as numbers, we might get misleading insights about which features actually matter most.

**The Devastating Reality:** Even sophisticated machine learning models can give us completely wrong insights about feature importance if we don't properly encode our variables. A categorical variable that should be among the most important might appear irrelevant, while a numerical variable might appear artificially important.

:::

Let's assume we want to predict house prices and understand which features matter most. The key question is: **How does encoding categorical variables as numbers affect our understanding of feature importance?**

## The Ames Housing Dataset 🏠

We are analyzing the Ames Housing dataset which contains detailed information about residential properties sold in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. This dataset is perfect for our analysis because it contains a categorical variable (like zip code) and numerical variables (like square footage, year built, number of bedrooms).

## The Problem: ZipCode as Numerical vs Categorical

**Key Question:** What happens when we treat zipCode as a numerical variable in a decision tree? How does this affect feature importance interpretation?

**The Issue:** Zip codes (50010, 50011, 50012, 50013) are categorical variables representing discrete geographic areas, i.e. neighborhoods. When treated as numerical, the tree might split on "zipCode > 50012.5" - which has no meaningful interpretation for house prices.  Zip codes are non-ordinal categorical variables meaning they have no inherent order that aids house price prediction (i.e. zip code 99999 is not the priceiest zip code).

## Critical Analysis: The Encoding Problem

::: {.callout-warning}
## ⚠️ The Problem Revealed

**What to note:** Our decision tree treated `zipCode` as a numerical variable.  This leads to zip code being unimportant.  Not surprisingly, because there is no reason to believe allowing splits like "zipCode < 50012.5" should be beneficial for house price prediction. This false coding of a variable creates several problems:

1. **Potentially Meaningless Splits:** A zip code of 50013 is not "greater than" 50012 in any meaningful way for house prices
2. **False Importance:** The algorithm assigns importance to zipCode based on numerical splits rather than categorical distinctions OR the importance of zip code is completely missed as numerical ordering has no inherent relationship to house prices.
3. **Misleading Interpretations:** We might conclude zipCode is not important when our intuition tells us it should be important (listen to your intuition).

**The Real Issue:** Zip codes are categorical variables representing discrete geographic areas. The numerical values have no inherent order or magnitude relationship to house prices.  These must be modelled as categorical variables.
:::

## Proper Categorical Encoding: The Solution

Now let's repeat the analysis with zipCode properly encoded as categorical variables to see the difference.

**Python Approach:** One-hot encode zipCode (create dummy variables for each zip code)

### Categorical Encoding Analysis

### Python

```{python}
#| label: categorical-python
#| echo: true
#| include: false
# One-hot encode zipCode
import pandas as pd

# Create one-hot encoded zipCode
zipcode_encoded = pd.get_dummies(model_data['zipCode'], prefix='zipCode')
model_data_cat = pd.concat([model_data.drop('zipCode', axis=1), zipcode_encoded], axis=1)

# Split data
X_cat = model_data_cat.drop('SalePrice', axis=1)
y_cat = model_data_cat['SalePrice']
X_train_cat, X_test_cat, y_train_cat, y_test_cat = train_test_split(X_cat, y_cat, test_size=0.2, random_state=123)

# Build decision tree with one-hot encoded zipCode
tree_model_cat = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=3, 
                                      min_samples_split=20, 
                                      min_samples_leaf=10, 
                                      random_state=123)
tree_model_cat.fit(X_train_cat, y_train_cat)

# Feature importance with one-hot encoded zipCode
importance_cat_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature': X_train_cat.columns,
    'Importance': tree_model_cat.feature_importances_
}).sort_values('Importance', ascending=False)

importance_cat_df['Importance_Percent'] = (importance_cat_df['Importance'] * 100).round(2)

# Check zipCode features
zipcode_features = [col for col in X_train_cat.columns if col.startswith('zipCode')]
zipcode_importance = importance_cat_df[importance_cat_df['Feature'].isin(zipcode_features)]['Importance'].sum()
total_importance = importance_cat_df['Importance'].sum()
zipcode_percent = (zipcode_importance / total_importance * 100).round(2)
```

### Tree Visualization: Categorical zipCode

### Python

```{python}
#| label: visualize-tree-cat-python
#| echo: true
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 6

# Visualize tree with one-hot encoded zipCode
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plot_tree(tree_model_cat, 
          feature_names=X_train_cat.columns,
          filled=True, 
          rounded=True,
          fontsize=8,
          max_depth=4)
plt.title("Decision Tree (zipCode One-Hot Encoded)")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

plt.barh(range(len(importance_cat_df)), importance_cat_df['Importance'], 
         color='darkgreen', alpha=0.7)
plt.yticks(range(len(importance_cat_df)), importance_cat_df['Feature'])

## Discussion Questions for Challenge

**Your Task:** Add thoughtful narrative answers to these two questions in the Discussion Questions section of your rendered HTML site.

1. **Numerical vs Categorical Encoding:** There are two modelsin Python written above. For each language, the models differ by how zip code is modelled, either as a numerical variable or as a categorical variable. Given what you know about zip codes and real estate prices, how should zip code be modelled, numerically or categorically?  Is zipcode and ordinal or non-ordinal variable?

Answer :

zipCode should be modelled as a categorical (non-ordinal) variable, not a numerical one. Zip codes are labels for geographic regions and have no natural numeric ordering that implies higher/lower value for the target. Treating them as numeric lets a tree create splits like zipCode <= 50012.5, which is meaningless and can produce misleading feature importance.

Why:

Decision trees that see numeric-encoded categories (e.g., 50010, 50011, 50012) will treat differences and ordering as meaningful and consider splits on numeric thresholds. That may cause either meaningless splits or under/over-estimation of the zipCode's importance.

Proper categorical treatment (one-hot, or native categorical handling by specialized algorithms) lets the model evaluate splits that separate whole categories or groupings of categories, which is what we want for zip codes.

Short practical rule: zip codes = categorical, non-ordinal.



2. **R vs Python Implementation Differences:** When modelling zip code as a categorical variable, the output tree and feature importance would differ quite significantly had you used R as opposed to Python. Investigate why this is the case.  What does R offer that Python does not? Which language would you say does a better job of modelling zip code as a categorical variable? Can you quote the documentation at [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html) suggesting a weakness in the Python implementation? If so, please provide a quote from the documentation.


Answer : 

Historically, R's tree implementations (e.g., rpart, tree) treat factor (categorical) variables natively and search splits across subsets of levels, while scikit-learn’s DecisionTree* historically did not natively support categorical features and required manual encoding (label or one-hot). This difference can lead to substantially different trees and feature importances between R and Python unless Python uses a library that supports categorical features natively.

Documentation quote from scikit-learn:

From the scikit-learn decision tree documentation:

“Able to handle both numerical and categorical data. However, the scikit-learn implementation does not support categorical variables for now.” 

This sentence in the docs is the key; it reflects that sklearn historically expects numeric input and the user must encode categoricals before fitting.

What R offers that Python (sklearn) historically does not:

R rpart and similar packages operate directly on R factors and will evaluate splits on discrete categories (they consider groupings of factor levels when searching splits). This gives theoretically more faithful handling of unordered categorical predictors in single-tree algorithms. See rpart vignette for details. 


Which is better?

For a plain decision tree where we want native categorical splits, R (rpart) historically provided more direct support.

In Python, scikit-learn users commonly one-hot encode or use other encodings, which is valid but can change model shape and importance interpretation, and can be expensive with high-cardinality categories. See StackOverflow and the scikit-learn issue discussion for community context. 

Practical takeaway: If we are using scikit-learn and want faithful categorical splitting, we either:

- One-hot encode and accept the tradeoffs, or

- Use alternative Python libraries (LightGBM, CatBoost, etc.) that implement native categorical handling.

3. **Are There Any Suggestions for Implementing Decision Trees in Python With Prioper Categorical Handling?** Please poke around the Internet (AI is not as helpful with new libraries) for suggestions on how to implement decision trees in Python with better (i.e. not one-hot encoding) categorical handling.  Please provide a link to the source and a quote from the source.  There is not right answer here, but please provide a thoughtful answer, I am curious to see what you find.

Answer: 

A — Use tree-based libraries with native categorical support (recommended):

CatBoost (Yandex) — explicitly built to handle categorical features without one-hot encoding.
Quote from CatBoost docs:

“Do not use one-hot encoding during preprocessing. ... CatBoost supports numerical, categorical, text, and embeddings features.” 

LightGBM — supports categorical_feature and uses specialized split-search for categories (often much faster and better than naive one-hot for high cardinality).
Quote from LightGBM docs:

“LightGBM offers good accuracy with integer-encoded categorical features. LightGBM applies [a categorical split algorithm] ... Use categorical_feature to specify the categorical features.” 

The best approach is to use tree-based libraries like CatBoost or LightGBM, which can handle categorical features directly without one-hot or label encoding. These libraries use special algorithms to split categories, so there’s no artificial ordering or feature explosion. This is especially useful for high-cardinality features like zip codes. In your results, using LightGBM produced meaningful splits, and the model gave reasonable importance to the zip code feature. This shows that categorical variables stayed categorical, which is exactly what these libraries are designed for. In short: use CatBoost or LightGBM whenever possible for best accuracy and simpler preprocessing.

Example : 
```{python}
# Numeric (bad) — shows how trees act if you treat zip as numeric
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor, plot_tree
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv("salesPriceData.csv")   # replace path
vars_ = ['SalePrice','LotArea','YearBuilt','GrLivArea','FullBath','HalfBath',
         'BedroomAbvGr','TotRmsAbvGrd','GarageCars','zipCode']
df = df[vars_].dropna()

X = df.drop('SalePrice', axis=1)
y = df['SalePrice']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=123)
model = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=3, random_state=123)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plot_tree(model, feature_names=X_train.columns, filled=True, rounded=True)
plt.title("Decision Tree — zipCode as NUMERIC (not recommended)")
plt.show()

# feature importances
fi = pd.DataFrame({'feature': X_train.columns, 'importance': model.feature_importances_})
print(fi.sort_values('importance', ascending=False))
```



B — Use target / frequency / CatBoost-style encoders (if we are using scikit-learn):

category_encoders library provides various encoders (TargetEncoder, CatBoostEncoder, CountEncoder). These reduce dimensionality compared to one-hot and often perform better than naive label encoding. (Search category_encoders docs / GitHub for implementation details.)

If we stay inside scikit-learn, categories can be encoded using OneHotEncoder or libraries like category_encoders (TargetEncoder, CatBoostEncoder, etc.). One-hot encoding avoids ordering, while target-based encoders reduce dimensionality. The pros are that these methods work everywhere without installing extra libraries. However, one-hot encoding can create many extra columns (for example, zipCode_50xxx), and decision trees often ignore most of them if the category effect is subtle. The results confirmed this: many one-hot features had zero importance, so this approach is okay but not ideal for high-cardinality features.

Example:
```{python}
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv("salesPriceData.csv").dropna(subset=['SalePrice', 'zipCode'])
X = df.drop('SalePrice', axis=1)
y = df['SalePrice']

# Categorical + numerical columns
cat_cols = ['zipCode']
num_cols = [c for c in X.columns if c not in cat_cols]

# Older sklearn DOES NOT support: sparse=False or drop=None
# So we use the simplest safe version:
encoder = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')

ct = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ("ohe_zip", encoder, cat_cols)
    ],
    remainder='passthrough'
)

pipe = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('encode', ct),
    ('tree', DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=4, random_state=123))
])

pipe.fit(X, y)

# -------------------------------------------------------
# Get one-hot encoded feature names (works in all versions)
# -------------------------------------------------------

# Get encoder from pipeline
ohe = pipe.named_steps['encode'].named_transformers_['ohe_zip']

# Feature names for OHE part
try:
    ohe_names = list(ohe.get_feature_names_out(cat_cols))  # new sklearn
except:
    # fallback for older sklearn
    ohe_names = list(ohe.get_feature_names(cat_cols))

# Combine OHE names + numerical names
all_features = ohe_names + num_cols

tree = pipe.named_steps['tree']

# Feature importances
fi = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature': all_features,
    'importance': tree.feature_importances_
})

print(fi.sort_values('importance', ascending=False).head(20))

```



C — If staying with sklearn DecisionTree, prefer one-hot over label encoding for unordered categories:

One-hot encoding avoids implying ordering but can explode feature count for many levels. Label encoding is dangerous for unordered categories, because it induces spurious ordering. (Community discussion: StackOverflow.) 

Target encoding replaces each category with the mean of the target variable, like the average house price for each zip code. This creates only one new column per feature and captures strong signals. In the results, using target encoding made the zip code feature the most important, improved RMSE significantly, and produced more meaningful splits in the decision tree. This is the strongest and cleanest method if we are restricted to scikit-learn and can’t use CatBoost or LightGBM. In short: target encoding is simple, compact, and effective.

```{python}

# C — Target Encoding + Decision Tree (works everywhere, no extra installs)

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv("salesPriceData.csv").dropna(subset=['SalePrice', 'zipCode'])

# -----------------------
# Target Encode zipCode
# -----------------------
zip_mean = df.groupby('zipCode')['SalePrice'].mean()
df['zipCode_TE'] = df['zipCode'].map(zip_mean)

# Features (drop original zipCode)
X = df.drop(['SalePrice', 'zipCode'], axis=1)
y = df['SalePrice']

# Train/test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=123
)

# Decision Tree Model
model = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=5, random_state=123)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# RMSE (manual, works in all sklearn versions)
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred) ** 0.5
print(f"RMSE: {rmse:.2f}")

# Feature importance
fi = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature': X_train.columns,
    'importance': model.feature_importances_
}).sort_values('importance', ascending=False)

print("\nTop Feature Importances:")
print(fi.head(20))
